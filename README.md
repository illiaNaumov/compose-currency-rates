# Currency rates app with Jetpack Compose

## How to run
Please set you App id in ```Constant``` file

## Further improvements
- It would be great to implement functionality to chose a year
- Make table vertically scrollable. For now it just scrolls horizontally
- It would be nice to have currency code column fixed. It will help user not be confused with currency codes.
- Exception handling should be provided
- It would be great to avoid of hardcoded currency codes. There an API method ```/currencies.json```
- It will be nice to add pull-to-refresh functionality
